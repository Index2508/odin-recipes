    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Greek baklava is a delightful and indulgent pastry that originates from Greece and is renowned for its rich flavors and delicate layers. This delectable treat consists of thin sheets of phyllo dough, which are generously brushed with butter or olive oil, layered with a scrumptious mixture of finely chopped nuts, usually walnuts, almonds, or pistachios, and then sweetened with a fragrant blend of cinnamon and cloves.</p>

        <p>Once the layers are stacked, the pastry is expertly cut into diamond or square shapes before being baked to a golden, flaky perfection. After baking, a sweet syrup, often infused with honey, lemon, and orange, is poured over the warm baklava, saturating each layer and creating a delectable, sticky sweetness.</p>

It is commonly served during festive occasions, family gatherings, and celebrations, symbolizing warmth, hospitality, and the joy of sharing food with loved ones. With its exquisite blend of textures and flavors, Greek baklava is a true delicacy that leaves a lasting impression on anyone fortunate enough to savor its tempting allure.</p>
