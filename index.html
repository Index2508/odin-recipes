    <h3>description</h3>
    <p>Chocolate cake is a moist and tender dessert made with cocoa powder, known for its rich and indulgent flavors. Layered with a luscious chocolate frosting, it creates a heavenly treat that satisfies any chocolate lover's cravings. Whether enjoyed alone or with a scoop of ice cream, chocolate cake is a timeless classic that brings joy and delight to any occasion.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <p>You probably already have all the ingredients you'll need to make this rich chocolate cake. If not, here's what to put on your grocery list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <p>Two cups of white sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness while locking in the moisture from the other ingredients.</p>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <p>All-purpose flour provides structure, acts as a thickening agent, and helps build the fluffy texture.</p>
        <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
        <p>Of course, you'll want to use Hershey's brand unsweetened cocoa powder for this one. It adds the rich, indulgent flavour you know and loves.</p>
        <li>Leaveners</li>
        <p>Baking powder and baking soda act as learners, which means they cause the batter to expand and give the cake a perfect rise.</p>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <p>Just a teaspoon of salt is all you'll need to add complexity and highlight the other flavours. It might not seem like a lot, but you'll miss the salt if you skip it.</p>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <p>Whole eggs affect the cake in several ways: They provide structure, add moisture, lend flavour, and contribute to a tender texture.</p>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <p>Whole milk adds moisture and helps the batter come together smoothly.</p>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <p>Vegetable oil ensures your cake will never be dry.</p>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
        <p>Two teaspoons of vanilla extract add complex flavour and bring out the flavours of the other ingredients, such as cocoa powder.</p>
        <li>Boiling Water</li>
        <p>You might be wondering why this recipe calls for a cup of boiling water. It intensifies the chocolatey flavour, contributes to the fluffy texture, and reacts with the learners to create an even higher rise.
